Weather-Forecast project in python:


Description:

This project is a weather forecast project which gets data from OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve real-time weather data based on a city name provided by the user. It is built with a focus on user-friendliness, allowing individuals to easily access current weather conditions without any complex setup. By simply entering the name of a city, users can obtain vital information about the weather, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions. It is structured to handle potential errors gracefully, ensuring that users receive a message if the city name is invalid or if there are issues with the API request. This enhances the overall user experience by providing clear and concise information. This weather forecast project is a practical example of how to use Python to interact with web APIs, handle user input, and present data in a meaningful way.
